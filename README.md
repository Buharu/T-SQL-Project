Implement a database in T-SQL for managing an organization or a system.

Create a document in which you describe:
 - the purpose of the application,
 - the related tables (at least 5) and the constraints,
 - provide the database diagram,
 - write realistic queries (at least 20), specific to the application, and for each query, include:
    * the corresponding T-SQL code
    * the result of its execution.
